## Changing Roommates 
You are about to begin your second year at IIT Kanpur, a new opportunity to make girlfriend, to get your academic comeback(as though it is possible),but also getting inflicted by new ways of torture(ðŸ˜° ,best of luck if you are in the MTH dept.).

No problem !! It is only the begin of the semester , you can enjoy for now right? Oh what's that I hear, your wingies are quarreling over who will their roommates be, some want to go with new roommates ,some cann't bare their old roommates.

Being the only sensible person in your wing you decide to take the situation in your own hand, you ask your wingies to choose a person with whom they want to be roommates with, but they have to act fast ,as roommates are decided on first come first serve basis . 

Everyone agrees and gives you their preferences.


Following are the conditions for deciding roommates:-  
1. All the members of the wing have been assigned a number.
2. There are 12 members in your wing, 3 double sharing room and 2 triple sharing room.
1. If any 2 people want to go together, they should be given priority.
2. If you have 3 people who are each others choice   
    Example:  
    If 1 wants to go with 2 , 2 wants to go with 3 and 3 wants to go with 1, then put them in triple sharing room
    `NOTE: There are only 2 triple sharing rooms.`
5. If none of the above conditions are satisfied, allocate room mates on the first come first serve basis.
    `NOTE: First double sharing rooms are filled then triple sharing.`
6. If a person requests a roommate that has already been allocated a partner and this person is not chosen by any other person in the wing(Why is this character relatable?),they will be given the roommate at the last, when all others have been allocated.(Based on Real Incidents)

**Print out the resulting roommates in the First come first serve order(ie the same order as the input.),print it after arranging in ascending order.**

## Example 
1. The input is give as the number of the person who has requested roommate and the person he chooses as roommate. 

**Input**:

5 7
7 2
3 9
9 11
11 4
10 2
6 11
8 6
4 8

```

**Expected output:**  
```
1 12
2 5 7
3 9
